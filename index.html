							<p>
								I am the strongest person I know, and every day I continue to impress myself with my determination and perserverance.
								I am a first generation student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing higher education in Astronomy, Psychology, and Math.
								The process of getting to where I am now was far from easy, but I have learned to cherish every step of the way. 
								The people and circumstances in my life haven't always been reliable or constant, but the stars always were. 
								I feel a deep connection with the stars. When I look up into the night sky, it feels as though I am looking into a mirror.
								I believe that the stars have a lot to teach us about ourselves, and that is precisely why I am studying astronomy and psychology.
								It gives me purpose, and I hope that into time I can help people find theirs.

							<p> So what am I up to now? I am currently a full time student at CU Boulder and I work part time as a 
								navigator at Fiske Planetarium. In my classes I am learning about electricity and magnetism, as well as
								coding in Python. At Fiske I am running visuals for public astronomy shows and will hopefully be doing this 
								for astronomy classes this coming fall semester. I am also learning how to make music shows using a laser software
								Lots of exciting stuff!
								Outside of school and work, I have been trying to enjoy the summer Sun by hiking, swimming, and skateboarding.
								I love being active and exploring new places. On some weekends, (feels like most weekends), I am out at concerts
								having fun with my friends. I am a big music lover and recently have been super into EDM. 
								There is never a dull day in the life of Alexis.
